# Use cases

## UC1: Create a question bank
Description: The instructor logs on to the site and click on question bank creation. He will see the list of questions in the system and their categories. He enters the form which provides a series of question, answer and category then press the submit button. He will see his newly added question in the list of questions

## UC2: Create a quiz game
Description: The instructor logs on to the game and click on quiz creation. He enters the name, number of groups, number of categories, number of questions per categories and the time limit. He will see a Jeopardy board. He then clicks on the category header to set the name. After that he clicks on a table cell to enter their prize and select question from the question bank.

The game should suggest questions from the same category as the table header but if it is not present or the instructor choose to, he then can select any question in the system.

After this is completed he clicks save and the game give him a link which could be shared with the students.

## UC3: Answering a question
Description: Students log-on to the game using instructor's given link. They will be presented with a Jeopardy board same as what the instructor had setup earlier.

The instructor asks the students verbally to choose a question and select that question. The game will show the question to both instructors and the students but the correct answer is not visible to the students.

The instructor then signals the starting period which a timer will be running. The students can press a button to get a chance to answer. The first student pressed will be asked the answer verbally within a time limit and if he answered correctly the instructor add points equated to the questions' prize to their team or subtract the equated point if the student answered incorrectly.

If the time limit runs out the student will get a penalty same as answering incorrectly. The starting period will be restarted again.

If the timer of the starting period runs out and nobody rings in, or if a student has answered correctly, the game will return to the Jeopardy board and start again.
