## WHAT is their need

The instructor want to play games with students in class but he had several problems:

- He doesn't know who ring in first because the classroom is large and the students aren't sitting together
- The design of existing software is not attractive for the students'
- He want students to be able to join remotely too
- He want the students to answer in a short period of time when rang in but he doesn't want to use a stopwatch

So with these problems he can't hold class activities quite well.

Our solution will make the class activity more interesting, fun and easy to held.
