Instructors

## WHAT is their need

The instructor wants to play games with students in the class but he had several problems:

- He had a hard time figuring out who rang in first from the fact that the classroom is too big and there are lots of students.
- The design of the existing software is not attractive for the students
- He wants the students to be able to join remotely too
- He wants the students to answer in a short period of time when rang in. On the other hand, he doesn't want to use the stopwatch.

These problems causes him to have a hard time holding class activites.

Our solution will make the class activity more interesting, fun and easy to held.
